A fully CGI commercial for Behaton, a leading manufacturer of concrete paving tiles. The project demonstrates the aesthetic versatility and durability of Behaton's product range through photorealistic 3D environments and dynamic camera work.

The commercial features architectural visualization of urban and residential spaces where Behaton tiles are used, showcasing different patterns, colors, and installation contexts. Attention to detail in material rendering was critical to the project's success.

Pixels2Pixels Studio handled concept development, 3D modeling, animation, lighting, rendering, and post-production, delivering a broadcast-ready commercial that elevated the Behaton brand.
