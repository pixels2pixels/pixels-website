A fully CGI television commercial for the Dodge Ram, showcasing the vehicle's power and capability through cinematic 3D animation. Unlike traditional automotive commercials that rely on live-action filming, this project was created entirely in 3D — offering complete creative control over environments, lighting, and camera movement.

The commercial features the Dodge Ram navigating dramatic landscapes, with dynamic camera angles and atmospheric effects that emphasize the truck's commanding presence. Particle systems, fluid simulations, and advanced lighting rigs were used to create sequences of broadcast quality.

Pixels2Pixels Studio delivered a fully finished commercial ready for broadcast and digital distribution, demonstrating the cost-effectiveness and creative freedom of CGI-first production approaches.
