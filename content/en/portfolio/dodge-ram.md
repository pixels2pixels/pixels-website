## About the Project

A high-fidelity 3D visualization project for the iconic Dodge Ram truck. This project showcases the vehicle's powerful design through photorealistic CGI rendering, capturing every detail from the aggressive front grille to the rugged body lines.

## Our Approach

The project required extensive 3D modeling work to accurately replicate the vehicle's geometry, followed by advanced material and shader development to achieve true-to-life paint, chrome, and rubber surfaces. Dynamic lighting setups were used to highlight the truck's form in dramatic fashion.

## Results & Delivery

Pixels2Pixels Studio delivered a series of hero shots and animated sequences suitable for digital advertising, social media campaigns, and product launch materials.
