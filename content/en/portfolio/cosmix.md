Cosmix is an immersive web experience built with cutting-edge web technologies. The project features a stunning interactive 3D environment powered by Three.js and React, delivering a seamless and visually captivating user journey.

The website showcases an interactive particle network that responds to user input in real time, creating a sense of depth and engagement rarely seen in standard web projects. The design language is futuristic and minimal, with a dark color palette and glowing neon accents.

Pixels2Pixels Studio was responsible for the full design and development of the Cosmix web platform, including 3D scene composition, performance optimization, and responsive layout engineering.
