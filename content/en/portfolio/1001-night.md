## About the Project

1001 Night is a visually stunning 3D animation project inspired by the rich tapestry of Arabian Nights folklore. The project combines photorealistic 3D environments with stylized character animation to create a cinematic experience that transports viewers into a world of magic and mystery.

## Our Approach

Every scene was meticulously crafted using industry-leading 3D software, with particular attention to lighting, atmospheric effects, and texture detail. The result is a breathtaking visual narrative that demonstrates the full scope of Pixels2Pixels Studio's 3D capabilities.

## Results & Delivery

The project involved concept art, 3D modeling, rigging, animation, VFX compositing, and final color grading — a complete end-to-end production pipeline.
