## About the Project

An extended reality experience created in partnership with Red Bull and the Alinghi sailing team, one of the most successful America's Cup competitors in history. The project brought the thrill of high-performance sailing to audiences worldwide through an immersive XR experience.

## Our Approach

Users could virtually step aboard the Alinghi racing yacht, experiencing the speed, precision, and teamwork of elite sailing through interactive VR and AR elements. The experience was designed for both public events and digital distribution, reaching fans who could never attend a race in person.

## Results & Delivery

Pixels2Pixels Studio developed the full XR experience — including 3D environment creation, real-time physics simulation, interactive UI design, and cross-platform deployment for VR headsets and mobile AR devices.
