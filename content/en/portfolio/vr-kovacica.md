## About the Project

VR Kovacica is a cultural heritage preservation and tourism project that creates a virtual reality experience of Kovacica, a village in Serbia renowned for its naive art tradition and Slovak cultural heritage. The project allows visitors from around the world to explore the village's unique character digitally.

## Our Approach

The VR experience features photorealistic recreations of key cultural landmarks, interactive exhibits showcasing the naive art tradition, and guided tours narrated in multiple languages. The project serves both as a tourism promotion tool and an educational resource for schools and cultural institutions.

## Results & Delivery

Pixels2Pixels Studio collaborated closely with the Municipality of Kovacica and local cultural organizations to ensure authentic representation of the community's heritage, delivering an experience that has been exhibited at international tourism fairs and cultural events.
