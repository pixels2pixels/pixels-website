A high-end video production project for Volkswagen Group, created for their regional sales network. The project involved producing a series of motivational and educational videos for VW Group dealership staff across multiple markets.

The production combined dynamic live-action footage with motion graphics, data visualization, and branded animations to create engaging content that communicates complex sales strategies and product knowledge in an accessible format.

Pixels2Pixels Studio managed the full production pipeline — from creative concept and scripting through filming, editing, color grading, sound design, and final delivery in multiple formats and languages.
