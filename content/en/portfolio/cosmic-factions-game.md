## Project Overview

Cosmic Factions is a deep space strategy game that combines traditional mobile gaming with Web3 mechanics, allowing players to truly own their in-game assets through blockchain technology. Pixels2Pixels Studio served as the primary development partner from concept to launch.

## Challenge

The client wanted to create a mobile strategy game that stood out in a crowded market by offering genuine asset ownership through NFTs, while maintaining the accessibility and fun of traditional mobile games. The technical challenge was integrating blockchain without compromising the gaming experience.

## Solution

We built Cosmic Factions from the ground up using Unity for the game engine and Ethereum/Polygon for the blockchain layer. The result is a seamless experience where players can collect, trade, and battle with unique space fleets they genuinely own.

The game features over 200 unique ship designs, each with distinct stats and rarity levels. The real-time multiplayer system supports up to 8 players simultaneously, with custom matchmaking algorithms ensuring fair and competitive matches.

## Results

The game launched to strong reception, achieving over 50,000 downloads in the first month and maintaining a 4.6-star rating across app stores. The NFT marketplace generated significant trading volume, demonstrating strong player engagement with the ownership mechanics.

## Technology Stack

Unity 2022 LTS, Photon Fusion for networking, Polygon blockchain, OpenSea integration, AWS GameLift for server infrastructure, and custom analytics pipeline.
