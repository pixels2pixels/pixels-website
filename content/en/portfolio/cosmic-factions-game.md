## About the Project

Cosmic Factions is a deep-space mobile strategy game that combines compelling gameplay with blockchain-based asset ownership. Players command fleets of starships, colonize planets, and engage in strategic battles across a procedurally generated galaxy — all while truly owning their in-game assets as NFTs.

The game features a rich lore, multiple playable factions with unique abilities, and a competitive multiplayer ecosystem that rewards skill and strategic thinking.

## Our Approach

Pixels2Pixels Studio led the full game development lifecycle — from initial game design and concept art through Unity development, smart contract integration, and backend infrastructure. We built a custom procedural galaxy generator that creates unique, replayable maps for each session.

The blockchain integration was designed to be seamless — players interact with NFT assets naturally within the game without needing to understand the underlying technology. Smart contracts handle all asset ownership, trading, and marketplace transactions transparently.

## Results & Delivery

The game launched successfully on both App Store and Google Play, achieving strong early retention metrics. The NFT marketplace saw active trading in the first month, with player-owned assets exchanged on secondary markets.

The project demonstrated that blockchain gaming can deliver genuine entertainment value beyond speculative asset trading, setting a new standard for play-to-own experiences.
