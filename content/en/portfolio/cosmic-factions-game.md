Cosmic Factions is a deep-space mobile strategy game that combines compelling gameplay with blockchain-based asset ownership. Players command fleets of starships, colonize planets, and engage in strategic battles across a procedurally generated galaxy — all while truly owning their in-game assets as NFTs.

The game features a rich lore, multiple playable factions with unique abilities, and a competitive multiplayer ecosystem. The blockchain integration allows players to trade ships, resources, and territories on open markets, creating a player-driven economy.

Pixels2Pixels Studio led the full game development lifecycle — from game design and concept art through Unity development, smart contract integration, backend infrastructure, and App Store/Google Play deployment.
