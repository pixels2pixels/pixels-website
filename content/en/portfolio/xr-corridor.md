## About the Project

XR Corridor is an architectural visualization and interactive experience project that transforms a physical corridor space into an immersive extended reality environment. The project demonstrates how XR technology can enhance architectural presentations and spatial design reviews.

## Our Approach

Using real-time 3D rendering, the experience allows stakeholders to walk through and interact with architectural designs before construction begins, identifying design issues and exploring material options in an intuitive, embodied way. The system supports both VR headset and mixed reality viewing modes.

## Results & Delivery

Pixels2Pixels Studio handled the full XR development pipeline — from 3D environment modeling and optimization through real-time rendering setup, interaction design, and deployment on enterprise XR hardware platforms.
