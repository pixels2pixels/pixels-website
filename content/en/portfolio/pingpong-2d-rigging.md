A character rigging and animation project for PingPong'd, bringing a cast of expressive 2D characters to life with fluid, responsive animation. The project required creating sophisticated rig systems that allow animators to quickly produce a wide range of emotional expressions and physical actions.

Each character was rigged with a full set of facial controls, body deformers, and IK/FK switching systems, enabling nuanced performance animation. The rigging approach was optimized for production efficiency, allowing the client's animation team to work rapidly without sacrificing quality.

Pixels2Pixels Studio delivered complete character rigs with documentation and animation test sequences, providing the PingPong'd team with a solid foundation for their ongoing animation production.
