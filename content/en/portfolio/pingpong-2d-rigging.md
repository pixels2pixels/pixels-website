## About the Project

A character rigging and animation project for PingPong'd, bringing a cast of expressive 2D characters to life with fluid, responsive animation. The project required creating sophisticated rig systems that allow animators to quickly produce a wide range of emotional expressions and physical actions.

## Our Approach

Each character was rigged with a full set of facial controls, body deformers, and IK/FK switching systems, enabling nuanced performance animation. The rigging approach was optimized for production efficiency, allowing the client's animation team to work rapidly without sacrificing quality.

## Results & Delivery

Pixels2Pixels Studio delivered complete character rigs with documentation and animation test sequences, providing the PingPong'd team with a solid foundation for their ongoing animation production.
