## Project Overview

This immersive VR training simulator was developed for a major industrial client to replace traditional safety training programs. The platform allows employees to practice complex safety procedures in a fully simulated environment before performing them in real-world conditions.

## Challenge

The client faced significant challenges with traditional safety training:
- High cost of physical training setups
- Risk of accidents during live training
- Inconsistent training quality across locations
- Difficulty tracking trainee progress and performance

## Solution

We developed a comprehensive VR training platform using Unity and Meta Quest headsets, featuring:

- **Realistic 3D environments** modeled after actual industrial facilities
- **Interactive safety procedures** with step-by-step guidance
- **Performance analytics** tracking completion rates, errors, and time
- **Multi-user support** for collaborative training scenarios
- **Offline capability** for use in areas with limited connectivity

## Results

- **40% reduction** in on-site safety incidents within 6 months
- **60% cost savings** compared to traditional training programs
- **95% trainee satisfaction** score
- Deployed across **12 facilities** in 3 countries

## Technology Stack

- Unity 2022 LTS
- Meta Quest 2 & 3
- Photon Networking (multiplayer)
- Custom analytics dashboard
- AWS backend for data storage
