A professional video production and 3D visualization project for AXYZ International, a leading manufacturer of CNC routing and cutting systems. The project showcases the precision engineering and versatility of AXYZ's industrial machinery through a combination of live-action footage and CGI enhancement.

The production involved on-site filming at manufacturing facilities, combined with 3D animations that illustrate the machine's internal mechanisms and operational capabilities. This hybrid approach allowed complex technical features to be communicated clearly and compellingly to both technical and non-technical audiences.

The final deliverable was a comprehensive suite of video content for trade shows, the company website, and distributor training materials.
