A premium product visualization project for HSI Professional's Glider Press hair straightener. The project required creating photorealistic 3D renders and animations that showcase the product's sleek design, advanced ceramic plates, and ergonomic form factor.

The visual content was designed for use across e-commerce platforms, digital advertising, and social media, requiring multiple aspect ratios and animation styles. Special attention was paid to surface materials — the glossy finish, metallic accents, and LED indicator details were rendered with exceptional fidelity.

Pixels2Pixels Studio delivered a complete library of product shots, 360-degree rotation animations, and feature-highlight sequences that significantly enhanced HSI Professional's digital marketing presence.
