## Project Overview

Dorier Group, a leading event production company, commissioned Pixels2Pixels Studio to create a groundbreaking augmented reality experience for a major international corporate event in Geneva. The goal was to transform a traditional conference venue into an immersive digital environment that would leave attendees with an unforgettable experience.

## Challenge

The project presented several unique challenges. The experience needed to work reliably for hundreds of simultaneous users across a large physical space, without requiring app downloads or specialized hardware. It also had to be visually spectacular while remaining intuitive enough for non-technical attendees.

## Solution

We developed a WebAR solution using 8th Wall technology, allowing attendees to access the experience directly through their smartphone browsers. The experience featured animated 3D characters that appeared to walk through the venue, interactive product showcases triggered by physical markers, and a shared AR photo opportunity that became a social media highlight of the event.

The entire experience was designed and built in six weeks, including custom 3D assets, animations, and a real-time backend to handle concurrent users.

## Results

The AR experience was used by over 800 attendees during the two-day event, with an average engagement time of 4.5 minutes per session. The shared photo feature generated over 2,000 social media posts, significantly amplifying the event's digital reach. Dorier Group has since commissioned three additional AR experiences from Pixels2Pixels Studio.

## Technology Stack

8th Wall WebAR, Three.js, custom 3D assets in Blender, AWS Lambda for backend, and a custom analytics dashboard for real-time monitoring.
